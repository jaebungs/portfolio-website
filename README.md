# Welcome to Jae's portfolio

I was a maintenance technician for several years troubleshooting things.   
One day, I decided to do something I always wanted to do! Programming and writing. It wasn't easy.  
However, as I study more and create more projects, I couldn't stop thinking about going into a full-time developer.  
I am enjoying this journey and hoping to continue with talented people.

### Problem  
React-spring Parallax is wrapping whole components and change to absoulte position with overflow hidden.
