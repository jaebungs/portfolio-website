# Welcome to Jae's portfolio

I am enjoying this journey and hoping to continue with talented people.  

This site is built with CRA, SCSS and React-Spring.  
I'll make sure use ESLint for next project. It was super useful.

### Problem  
React-spring Parallax is wrapping whole components and change to absoulte position with overflow hidden.
If someone is checking its responsiveness by changing browser size, please refresh every time.
